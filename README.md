Maybe I will make a game or something (?)

## Target MVP

## Stretch Goals
* 3 player game


# Notes
## To Do: Short Term Goals
* Create place holder beef, barley, goose jpg images
## To Do: Future Tasks
* Convert vector images to bitmap on startup
## Gameplay
Characters:
* Beef - human character
* Barley - cute little Barley with face
* Goose - 

General mechanics (possibilities):
1. Beef as main character with Barley as a support char that gives bonuses, health packs, etc. Goose is a support char that can honk (with cool down) to scare away certain enemies, or maybe some sort of earth quake.
2. You unlock each character as you progress. Assemble a team to accomplish some goal, defeat bosses, etc. Two thoughts on possibilities:
    a.  Can rotate through the characters in game (such as pokemon trainer in smash). 
    b. Select before room.
3. Could have a center room / base from which to launch missions. With a map with position marker etc.
